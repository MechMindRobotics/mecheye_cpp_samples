## Sample List

Samples are divided into five categories, **Basic**, **Advanced**, **Util**, **Laser** and **UHP**.

- **Basic**: camera connection and basic capturing functions.
- **Advanced**: advanced capturing functions.
- **Util**: obtain information from a camera and set camera parameters.
- **Laser**: for Laser/LSR series cameras only.
- **UHP**: for UHP series cameras only. 

The samples marked with `(OpenCV)` require [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) to be installed.  
The samples marked with `(PCL)` require [PCL](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases) to be installed.
