## Sample Usage

### Overview

This sample program performs calibration and stitching operations for multiple laser profilers that scan the same object. It supports:

1. Calibration of laser profilers relative to a primary device.
2. Point cloud stitching in the scenario of one primary device.
3. Point cloud stitching in the scenario of multiple primary devices.

---

### 1. Main Menu Operations

Launch the program and choose an operation:

| Command | Description                                                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `C`     | Calibrate secondary profilers relative to a primary laser profiler |
| `S`     | Stitch point clouds using one primary laser profiler               |
| `M`     | Stitch point clouds using multiple primary laser profilers         |

---

### 2. Calibration Workflow (Option: `C`)

#### Step 1: Define Frustum Dimensions

Input the dimensions of the frustums of the calibration target when prompted:

* **Top Length** (mm): Upper base length of the frustums (e.g., `100.0`).
* **Bottom Length** (mm): Lower base length of the frustums (e.g., `150.0`).
* **Height** (mm): Height of the frustums (e.g., `50.0`).

> ðŸ’¡ *Confirm values with `y` or re-enter if incorrect.*

#### Step 2: Connect Profilers

* Automatic detection connects all available profilers.
* Ensure devices are powered and accessible via SDK.

#### Step 3: Identify Devices

* **Major Profiler**: Primary reference device (usually first in the device list)
* **Minor Profilers**: Secondary devices to calibrate relative to the primary device.

#### Step 4: Set Calibration Parameters

For each secondary laser profiler, configure:

**Mode Selection:**

* `wide` (translation-based, i.e., side-by-side or in the reversed direction)
* `angle` (rotation-based, i.e., in the opposite direction or around a circle)

**Pose Parameters:**

* *Translation Mode*:
  * Distance (mm) between two frustums of the calibration target (e.g., `200.0`).
  * Translation axis (`X`, `Y`, or `Z`): the axis along which one frustum is translated relative to another.
* *Rotation Mode*:
  * Rotation angle (Â°) between two frustums of the calibration target (e.g., `30.0`).
  * Rotation radius (mm): distance from the rotation center to the midpoint of the frustum's height (e.g., `50.0`).
  * Rotation axis (`X`, `Y`, or `Z`): the axis along which one frustum is rotated relative to another.

> ðŸ’¡ *Review inputs and confirm with `y`.*

#### Step 5: Execute Calibration

* Data acquisition is initiated automatically.
* **Ensure**:
  * A clear view of the calibration target
  * Stable ambient lighting conditions
* Results are saved automatically to the specified folder (e.g., `C:/calibration_results`)

#### Step 6: Stitching (Optional)

* After calibration, enter `y` to start stitching and/or fusing:
  * Stitched point cloud is saved as a `.ply` file.
  * Perform fusion if the laser profilers are Z-parallel and not in the opposite setup.

---

### 3. Single Primary Stitching (Option: `S`)

#### Step 1: Connect Laser Profilers

* Devices are automatically detected.

#### Step 2: Acquire Data

* System acquires 2D images and depth maps from all profilers.

#### Step 3: Load Calibration Data

* Provide path to existing calibration files (e.g., `C:/calibration_files`)

#### Step 4: Stitch and Save

* Stitched point cloud is generated and saved at specified path.
* Follow on-screen prompts for fusion (if applicable).

---

### 4. Multi-Primary Stitching (Option: `M`)

#### Step 1: Load Multiple Calibration Files

Input paths for three calibration pairs:

1. Primary 0 + Secondary 1 (e.g., `C:/calib_01`)
2. Primary 0 + Secondary 2 (e.g., `C:/calib_02`)
3. Primary 2 + Secondary 3 (e.g., `C:/calib_23`)

#### Step 2: Connect Profilers

* System verifies connection for all laser profilers.

#### Step 3: Acquire Data

* Data is automatically acquired from all laser profilers.

#### Step 4: Stitch Across Devices

* Computes transformations using loaded calibration data.
* Saves stitched point cloud to user-defined path.

---

### Key Notes

#### File Paths

* Use **English-only characters** in paths (e.g., avoid characters in `ä¸­æ–‡` or `æ—¥æœ¬èªž`)
* Ensure write permissions to target folders

#### Profiler Arrangement

* Z-parallel setups yield best fusion results.
* Opposite setups may prevent fusion.

#### Error Handling

* Detailed error messages are displayed for failed data acquisition or calibrations.
* Check device connections and retry.

### Troubleshooting Tips

| Error Message          | Solution                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| "Capture failed"       | Ensure all laser profilers are visible to system  |
| "Failed to save files" | Verify folder permissions and path validity       |
| Calibration errors     | Re-measure target dimensions and retry            |
