# ConnectAndCaptureImage Project Overview

This is a simple example of how to find and connect an available Mech-Eye Device
and then capture color and depth data from Mech-Eye device and then print frame info.

You will learn how to:

* use Mech-Eye API,
* capture frame from Mech-Eye Device,
* print pixel info.

How to build:

* Windows:
  1. Copy ConnectAndCaptureImage folder to a location with Read and
   Write permissions (using the name `source`)
  2. Open CMake
      * Set Source code to `source`
      * Set Binaries to `source`/_build or any other writable location
      * Click Configure and Generate
  3. Open .sln file in Visual Studio
      * Build the solution by `Ctrl + Shift + B`
  4. Run ConnectAndCaptureImage
      * Connect to a device
  5. Add your code to run your code from this sample
* Linux:
  1. Configure the project with

      ```bash
      cmake .
      ```

  2. Build the project with

      ```bash
      make
      ```

  3. Run the project with

      ```bash
      ./ConnectAndCaptureImage
      ```

The application will print out resolution and pixel information of captured frames.
