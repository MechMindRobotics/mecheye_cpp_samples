# C++ Samples

This repository contains C++ samples for Mech-Eye SDK.

## Installation

1. Download and install [Mech-Eye SDK](https://www.mech-mind.com/download/camera-sdk.html).
2. Clone this repository to a specific folder.
3. Configure the sample solution with CMake, open it in Visual Studio, build and run it.

## Sample list

There are four categories of samples: **Basic**, **Advanced**, **Util**, and **Laser**.  

- The category **Basic** contains samples that are related to basic connecting and capturing.  
- The category **Advanced** contains samples that use advanced capturing tricks.  
- The category **Util** contains samples that get and print information and set parameters.  
- The category **Laser** contains samples that can only be used on Mech-Eye Laser cameras.  

The samples marked with `(OpenCV)` require [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) to be installed.  
The samples marked with `(PCL)` require [PCL](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases) to be installed.
